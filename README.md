## Description

#### When

I was in my first year of **preparatory school (CPGE)** after high school, in **2009**, when I programmed these games. I chose the computer science option and the courses were tough on Caml Light, a French language, mainly for study.

This language was, after all, quite complete and after I discover the possibility to handle screen drawing and keyboard inputs, I decided trying to program some games with it.

#### What

I programed 3 different games: a **breakout**, a **minesweeper** and a **reversi**.  These games were simple enough to be done in Caml, and represented a nice challenge.

* My teacher told me that a former student of his programed a **breakout** in Caml. It intrigued me and as I wanted to be the best in computer science, I decided to do it too. 
* One day we did as exercise a simulation of a **minesweeper** field and research function. I found this exercise quite fun and didn’t want to stop half way, so I decided to program the whole game. 
* By the end of the year, I wanted to go deeper video game programing and try to implement basic AI. I found that **reversi** was a good game to simulate a simple AI. So I programmed the game and a simple bot player. 

#### How

As mentioned, this project was developed in **Camel** using the **Camel Light** software. Surprisingly enough, Caml offered quite a lot of libraries to handle drawing, inputs and even sound. It contained all the basic functions needed to program a video game.

#### Note

If you want to try these games, you have to install the Camel Light software included with the .rar, launch it and then copy-paste the code of the game in order to play it.

I regret that I didn’t have enough time to go deeper in the reverse AI. As I didn’t know the deep strategy of the game, I just implemented simple behaviors, based on simple assertions. So the AI is quite easy to beat.

#### Note

As it was my first program, it’s of course full of terrible mistakes like memory loss (plus freeing local variables…) or awful design. Nonetheless the program is fully finished with highscore, option and no bugs (or at least no obvious ones)
